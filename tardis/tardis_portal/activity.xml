	      <description type="full">Proteases are enzymes that control key processes in humans. The research in this program
			will result in major discoveries in the field of proteases and their inhibitors, with a focus
			on inflammatory, cardiovascular and degenerative disease. The knowledge gained from
			this strong foundation of fundamental research will underpin the translational outcomes
			necessary to combat the debilitating effects of immunological dysfunction,
			conformational and cardiovascular disease.</description>

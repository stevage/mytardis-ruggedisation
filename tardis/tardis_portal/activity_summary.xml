		<title>Control of proteases in infectious, degenerative and cardiovascular
		disease</title>
		<funding_body>NHMRC</funding_body>
		<description>
			Proteases are enzymes that control key processes in humans. The research in this program
			will result in major discoveries in the field of proteases and their inhibitors, with a focus
			on inflammatory, cardiovascular and degenerative disease. The knowledge gained from
			this strong foundation of fundamental research will underpin the translational outcomes
			necessary to combat the debilitating effects of immunological dysfunction,
			conformational and cardiovascular disease.

		<title>Genetic and Bioinformatic analysis of complex human diseases
		</title>
		<funding_body>NHMRC</funding_body>
		<description>
			Some human diseases are common in families; examples include prostate cancer, blood
			cancers, epilepsy and diabetes. Therefore, close relatives of individuals with a disease
			have an increased risk of being affected by this disease, implying a genetic basis. Finding
			the cause of these diseases is difficult, we will be developing novel approaches to the
			identification of genes responsible for these diseases. This is the first step towards the
			development of treatments for affected individuals.
